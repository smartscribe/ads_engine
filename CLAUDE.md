# Ads Engine — JotPsych Creative Performance Harness

## Integrations
**All API keys and integration config live in global `~/.claude/.env` and `~/.claude/integrations.md`.** Do NOT create a project-level `.env`. Meta Ads keys are `META_ADS_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `META_ADS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `META_ADS_APP_ID` (note: names differ from `config/settings.py` — load from global env when running scripts).

**Never hardcode secrets as env-var fallbacks.** Use `os.environ["KEY"]` (fails loud if missing), never `os.environ.get("KEY", "actual-value-here")`. Fallbacks look harmless but they put live credentials into the repo — and GitHub push protection will block the push, which means by the time you notice, the key is already in a local commit object. On 2026-04-13 a Stripe `rk_live` key and Meta access token shipped this way, got caught by GitHub's scanner, required rotation, and required reflog purging.

## What This Is
A quant-style ad operations system: idea → creative variants → deploy → measure → decompose → learn → repeat.
Runs ads for JotPsych targeting BH clinicians and SMB clinic decision-makers on Meta and Google.

## Core Loop
1. **Intake** — Free-form ideas (text, voice, swipe files) → AI structures into creative briefs
2. **Generation** — Briefs → static + video ad variants (method TBD by intern)
3. **Review** — Gallery UI: Nate + Jackson approve/reject/annotate variants
4. **Deploy** — Approved ads → Meta Ads API + Google Ads API (full programmatic)
5. **Track** — Pull performance data daily via platform APIs
6. **Decide** — Daily scale / kill / wait recommendations (quant trading style)
7. **Regress** — Auto-decompose creative elements into MECE taxonomy → linear regression → learn what works

## Key Constraints
- Primary conversion event: first note completion
- Budget: $15-20k/mo, scaling
- No AI slop — creative must look and read human-quality
- Meta + Google handle audience selection; we optimize creative only
- All creative elements auto-tagged into MECE taxonomy (no manual tagging)
- Regression coefficients must be orthogonal — watch for covariance

## Architecture
- Python backend (engine/) — all pipeline logic
- Web dashboard (dashboard/) — gallery review, performance views, regression insights
- Slack integration — auto-updates on deploys, kills, scale-ups, daily digest
- Data stored locally initially (data/) — migrate to proper warehouse when volume demands it

## Current State of Ads (as of Mar 25, 2026)

### Team
Adam Harrison — marketing lead, full account history across Meta and Google. Sharing Meta API read-access keys with Alex.
Matt — Meta contractor, knows the account structure.
Jenna — Google Ads rep, recurring call.
Chris Hume — sales, SDR routing for lead form leads.
Alex Nikolaev — intern, owns creative generation pipeline. Has working OpenAI/DALL-E prototype with review dashboard.
Daniel Chadda — intern, owns creative design + LoRA experimentation. Repo cloned, cloud code set up. Delivering initial examples by 2026-03-26.

### Performance History (Feb–Mar 2026, discovery survey attribution)
| Week | Spend | First Notes | CpFN |
|------|-------|-------------|------|
| Jan 25–31 | $4,158 | 22 | $189 |
| Feb 1–7 | $4,243 | 16 | $265 |
| Feb 8–14 | $4,503 | 23 | $196 |
| Feb 15–21 | $4,247 | 12 | $354 |
| Feb 22–Mar 1 | $3,863 | 20 | $193 |
| Mar 1–7 | $3,434 | 18 | $191 |

CpFN swings wildly week-to-week. No consistent trend — feast and famine pattern.

### Channel Status
- **Meta** — Primary channel. ~$2.5–3K/wk. Farm vs. scale campaign structure in place.
  Lead form experiment launched Mar 11 showing early promise: 17–37 leads at ~$63/lead in 3 days at $200/day.
- **Google** — Non-brand paused, reallocated to Meta. Branded-only at ~$400/wk.
  Google tag is broken — showing 2 conversions in-platform vs. 15 in Metabase UTMs. Needs engineering fix.
- **LinkedIn** — On backburner.

### Known Issues
1. **2FA broke conversion tracking.** SMS verification for signups disrupted both Google tag firing and Meta optimization signals. Timing of perf degradation matches exactly.
2. **Attribution is a mess.** Meta and Google double-count conversions (view-through overlap). Discovery survey is treated as canonical but it's self-reported. No deduplication model exists.
3. **Creative assets are scattered.** Across Drive, inbox, Meta, Figma — no single source of truth. This engine is meant to fix that.
4. **Existing analysis tool.** A contractor uses an MCP-based tool (GoMarble) for automated creative analysis. Decide whether to replace with this engine or integrate.

### Creative Learnings (from weekly tests)
- **What works:** UGC-style video, motion/energy, get to product fast, visual proof of product in action, highlighting specific tasks, audit-risk angle showed early promise
- **What doesn't:** Static/boring, slow to show product, generic scripts
- **Best CpFN seen:** $64/note (winner promoted from farm to scale, Feb 1–7 week)
- **Kill threshold in practice:** ~$300+/note after sufficient spend

## Prototype Status (as of Mar 25, 2026)

### What Exists
- Alex has OpenAI (DALL-E) API wired to a review dashboard rendering generated images from prompts
- Gallery format matches Meta ad layout (headlines + descriptions in place)
- Still "wiring stage" — image quality is slop, prompt engineering needed

### Agreed Direction (from 3/25 kickoff)
1. **Rich ad component framework** — every element of an ad (CTA, value prop, hook, narrative structure, imagery style, emotional register) defined and generated coherently as a unit
2. **Concept → 20 variants** — human originates the concept (e.g. "famous movie psychiatrists"), engine handles all tactical variant creation (cropping, copy variations, image sourcing/generation)
3. **Feedback loop** — weekly review sessions (Nate + Jackson), critique captured via voice notes, synthesized into MD files that feed the generation context window. Preferences accumulate.
4. **Creative quality tactics** — AI images/video not lifelike enough yet. Use techniques like: rapid succession of stills for implied motion, slight modifications to real photos, style/negative prompts. Be "wiley" not just API-dependent.
5. **Meta API access:** full read+write via `META_ADS_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `~/.claude/.env` (user token "ads_2_nate", `ads_management` scope, expires ~2026-06-06). Use it directly — do not assume read-only.
6. **Image generation exploration** — DALL-E primary, Gemini worth testing (Google ecosystem has video/photo advantages). LoRA models on Daniel's radar.

### Open Workstreams
- Alex: prompt engineering for coherent multi-element ad generation, negative/style prompts, dashboard iteration
- Daniel: creative design research (dimensions, placement, best practices), LoRA experimentation, initial examples by 3/26
- Regression pipeline: not started yet, Alex excited about it — decompose creative elements into MECE taxonomy

## Roadmap

### Generation Pipeline: Phased Approach

**Phase 1 (current):** HTML/CSS template rendering via Playwright.
All ad images are generated deterministically from brand-consistent templates.
Full pixel control. Fast iteration. Clean regression data from day one.
Templates: Meta feed 1080×1080, Meta story 1080×1920, Google Display 1200×628,
and sub-variants (headline_hero, split_screen, stat_callout, testimonial, full_bleed, swipe_up).

**Phase 2 (next):** Integrate AI image generation alongside templates.
Candidates: Gemini Imagen, DALL-E, Flux, Ideogram, Midjourney (via API).
Goals: photorealistic clinician scenes, product-in-use shots, UGC-style visuals.
Key constraint: AI images must pass a human quality bar — no slop, no uncanny valley.
The regression model will eventually tell us which image styles drive CpFN, informing
whether AI-generated or template-rendered assets win.

**Phase 3 (future):** Video generation at scale.
Veo integration is scaffolded. Once image quality is proven, extend to short-form video
(5–15s) for Meta Reels/Stories and Google Video. LoRA fine-tuning (Daniel's workstream)
to lock in JotPsych visual identity across generated assets.
